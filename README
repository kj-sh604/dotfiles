## Info ##

personal collection of config files for my GNU/Linux set-up. I mostly use a cringe-looking Awesome Window Manager "rice", but on occasion, I also use the Xfce4 desktop environment.

I am currently using the `coreutils-hybrid` package on Arch Linux which integrates the Rust uutils alongside the GNU coreutils. You may want to remove the fish aliases involving the uutils, plan 9 utils, and alternate commands involving the coreutils to make my fish config work on your system.

Thank you very much checking out my GNU/Linux dotfiles ðŸ¤—
