personal collection of config files for my GNU/Linux set-up. I mostly use a cringe-looking Awesome Window Manager "rice", but on occasion, I also use the Xfce4 desktop environment.

I am currently using the `𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘦𝘶𝘵𝘪𝘭𝘴-𝘩𝘺𝘣𝘳𝘪𝘥` package on Arch Linux which integrates the Rust uutils alongside the GNU coreutils. You may want to remove the fish aliases involving the uutils, plan 9 utils, and alternate commands involving the coreutils to make my fish config work on your system.

Thank you very much for checking out my GNU/Linux dotfiles 🤗
