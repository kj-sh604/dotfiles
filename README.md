# my dotfiles

personal collection of config files for my Linux set-up. I mostly use a cringe-looking awesome-WM "rice", neovim, and the `fish` or `zsh` shell.

**dotfiles are updated nightly**

### note:

i am currently utilizing my personal `coreutils-hybrid` package, available [here](https://github.com/kj-sh604/coreutils-hybrid-pkgbuild). This package combines most of the rust uutils with some GNU coreutils that are deemed to be more reliable/stable.


if you prefer to use my dotfiles while sticking with the standard GNU coreutils, i recommend removing the `config.fish` and/or `.zshrc` aliases associated with the rust uutils.



please note that for the pre-aliased `yt-*` commands to work, you will need to have `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` installed.
