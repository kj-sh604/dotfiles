# my dotfiles

personal collection of config files for my Linux set-up. I mostly use a cringe-looking awesome-WM "rice", neovim, and the `fish` shell.

**dotfiles are updated nightly**

### note:

i am currently using the `𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘦𝘶𝘵𝘪𝘭𝘴-𝘩𝘺𝘣𝘳𝘪𝘥` package on Arch Linux which integrates the Rust uutils alongside the GNU coreutils. You may want to remove the fish aliases involving the uutils, plan 9 utils, and alternate commands involving the coreutils to make my fish config work on your system.



thank you very much for checking out my GNU/Linux dotfiles 🤗
